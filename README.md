# 🏛️ Test Automation Project: Homburg Appointment Booking System

An automated end-to-end (E2E) testing framework engineered for the municipal appointment booking widget used by the City of Homburg ([termine-reservieren.de/termine/homburg/](https://termine-reservieren.de/termine/homburg/)).

## 🚀 Tech Stack & Architecture

- **Framework:** Playwright (Node.js)
- **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Architecture Design:** Helper-based modular structure (`helpers.js`) to keep locators and reusable actions organized.
- **Network Interception & Safety:** API mocking using `page.route()` to simulate server failures (HTTP 500) and handle appointment slot selection safely without creating real database holds.
- **Virtual Time Manipulation:** Fast-forwarding client-side session timers via `page.clock` for instant execution of timeout scenarios.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Setup & Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LeraChuiko/e2e-automation-playwright-homburg.git
cd e2e-automation-playwright-homburg
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
```

### Execution Commands

```bash
npm test             # Run all tests in Headless mode
npm run test:ui      # Run tests in Playwright Interactive UI Mode
npm run test:headed  # Run tests in Headed mode (Visible browser)
npm run report       # Generate and view the HTML execution report
```

## ⚠️ CI/CD Execution Note & Constraints

A GitHub Actions workflow is fully configured in `.github/workflows/playwright.yml`. However, because the live target application uses aggressive Cloudflare/AWS bot-detection mechanisms that block hosted CI/CD runners, the test suite is optimally maintained and executed in local environments to ensure consistent, flake-free execution.
